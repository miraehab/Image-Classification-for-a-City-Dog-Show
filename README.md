Worked on this project during the <b>AI Programming with Python Nanodegree</b> Program by <b>Udacity</b>.

<h2>Description: </h2>
Used a <b>pre-trained model</b> to correctly identify which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs and calculate the stats of the data.

<h2>Objectives: </h2>

- Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.

- Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.

- Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.

- Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.

<h2>How to run?</h2>
Run the <b>shell script</b> file run_models_batch.sh to create files with the results.
