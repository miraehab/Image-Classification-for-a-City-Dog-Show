Worked on this project during the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program by Udacity.

<h2>Description: </h2>
Used a pre-trained model to correctly identify which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs and calculate the stats of the data.

<h2>Objectives: </h2>

- Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.

- Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.

- Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.

- Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.
